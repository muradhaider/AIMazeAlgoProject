# AIMazeAlgoProject

The goal of project1 is implementing the A* algorithm for path finding in a maze.

You will need to modify the starter code maze.py (on replit) that you already looked at for the Uninformed Search lab.

Among other things, you will need to:

Modify node class to add cost and heuristic attributes/functions
For a heuristic function: you can use the manhattan or euclidean distance
Add class AstarPQFrontier()
